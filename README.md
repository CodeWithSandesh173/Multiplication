# Multiplication
This Python script generates multiplication tables from 1 to 999,999, saving each table in a separate text file inside the mal folder. It automatically creates the folder if it doesn’t exist and writes each number’s table from 1 to 10. Warning: generating nearly a million files can take a lot of time and disk space.
